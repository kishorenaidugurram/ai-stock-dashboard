# 🔧 SETUP GUIDE: Configure AI Update Button with This Thread

## ⚠️ Important: One-Time Setup Required

The AI Update button needs to know the URL of **this specific chat thread** so it can open it directly.

## 📋 Step 1: Get This Thread's URL

### Option A: From Browser Address Bar
1. Look at your browser's address bar **right now** (while reading this)
2. You should see a URL like:
   ```
   https://www.genspark.ai/chat/XXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```
   or
   ```
   https://www.genspark.ai/spark/XXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```
3. **Copy the entire URL**

### Option B: From Share Button
1. Look for a "Share" button in this chat interface
2. Click it to get the thread URL
3. Copy the URL

## 📝 Step 2: Update the Dashboard Configuration

Once you have the URL, send me this message:

```
Set thread URL to: [paste your URL here]
```

**Example:**
```
Set thread URL to: https://www.genspark.ai/chat/abc123def456
```

## 🔄 Step 3: I'll Update the Code

After you provide the URL, I will:
1. Update the API endpoint with your thread URL
2. Rebuild the dashboard
3. Restart the service
4. Test that it opens the correct thread

**Time: ~30 seconds**

## ✅ Step 4: Test It!

After I update:

2. Click "🤖 AI Update" button
3. **This specific thread** will open in a new tab
4. Paste and send the command
5. Done!

With the specific thread URL:
- ✅ Button opens **this exact thread**
- ✅ Direct access - no searching
- ✅ Paste and send immediately

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Combine with Your Own Research**
The dashboard provides AI-curated data from multiple sources, but always do your own analysis before trading.

### 2. **Check Social Sentiment**
High bullish sentiment + brokerage BUY = strong signal
High bearish sentiment despite BUY = potential contrarian play

### 3. **Monitor Volume**
Breakout stocks with high social volume often see sustained momentum.

### 4. **Compare Timeframes**
Update at market open and close to track intraday sentiment changes.
